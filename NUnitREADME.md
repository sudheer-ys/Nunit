Task Description/Requirement: NUnit frameowrk shall allow user to perform unit testing interms of code coverage and logic coerage. Framework shall mock the user data and check the logic on providing the input.

High Level Synopsis: For any application, to promote the code-base to higher environments its mandatory to prove that the application will never break at any point of time. It should be defect free software.

Worked on the below aspects:
Code Reliablity
Code Maintainability
Faster testing & finding the early bugs in software lifecycle.

Output: Framework will perform assertions on the logics/functions by using custom attributes and static assert classes. Generates output by testing the conditions whether system under test satisfy a condition or not. if condition is satisfied then report shows pass else fail for all the functions on the application.
